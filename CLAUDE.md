# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is the **coming soon waitlist page** for **Resumate** - an AI-powered resume optimization and automation platform. This Next.js 15 application serves as the pre-launch landing page to collect early user signups and build anticipation for the main Resumate product.

### Main Resumate Project Context
- **Purpose**: AI-powered resume automation and optimization tool
- **Target Audience**: Job seekers looking to create ATS-optimized, professional resumes
- **Value Proposition**: Leverages AI to help users craft tailored, job-ready resumes that increase interview chances
- **Main Repository**: https://github.com/RulzOrg/resumate (main product)

### Waitlist Page Technical Stack
- **Framework**: Next.js 15.5.4 with App Router (`src/app` directory)
- **Language**: TypeScript 5 with strict mode enabled
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 4 with PostCSS
- **Fonts**: Geist Sans and Geist Mono from Google Fonts
- **Build Tool**: Turbopack (enabled in both dev and build)

## Development Commands

- **Development server**: `npm run dev` (uses Turbopack)
- **Build**: `npm run build` (uses Turbopack)
- **Production server**: `npm start`
- **Linting**: `npm run lint` (ESLint with Next.js config)

## Architecture

### Project Structure
- **`src/app/`**: Next.js App Router directory
  - `layout.tsx`: Root layout with font configuration and global CSS
  - `page.tsx`: Homepage component
  - `globals.css`: Global styles with Tailwind imports and CSS variables
- **`public/`**: Static assets (SVG icons and images)
- **Configuration files**: TypeScript, ESLint, PostCSS, and Next.js configs

### Key Features
- **Turbopack**: Enabled for both development and production builds for faster compilation
- **TypeScript**: Configured with path aliases (`@/*` maps to `./src/*`)
- **Dark Mode**: CSS variables setup in globals.css with `prefers-color-scheme` media query
- **Font Optimization**: Uses Next.js font optimization with Geist font family

### ESLint Configuration
- Uses Next.js core web vitals and TypeScript rules
- Ignores: `node_modules`, `.next`, `out`, `build`, `next-env.d.ts`

### Styling Setup
- Tailwind CSS 4 with inline theme configuration in globals.css
- CSS custom properties for colors and fonts
- Font variables injected via Next.js font optimization

## Common Tasks

3. **Performance**: Optimize for fast loading (crucial for landing pages)
4. **TypeScript**: Use TypeScript for all new files
5. **App Router**: Follow existing patterns in `src/app/`
6. **Path Aliases**: Import from `@/` for relative imports to src directory
7. **Theming**: Use existing CSS custom properties for consistent styling
8. **Development**: Leverage Turbopack's fast refresh during development

### Setup Instructions:

#### Option 1: Recommended - Auto-Trigger Setup
1. Create automation in Beehiiv dashboard named "ResuMate AI Waitlist Sequence"
2. Set trigger to **"New Subscriber"** (this will automatically enroll all new subscribers)
3. Design emails with ResuMate AI branding and messaging
4. Set delays between emails (immediate, +3 days, +7 days, etc.)
5. **Publish** the automation (not draft mode)
6. Leave `BEEHIIV_AUTOMATION_ID` empty or remove it from `.env.local`

#### Option 2: API-Based Enrollment (Advanced)
1. Create automation in Beehiiv dashboard named "ResuMate AI Waitlist Sequence"
2. Set trigger to **"Manual"** or **"API"** (if available)
3. Design emails with ResuMate AI branding and messaging
4. **Publish** the automation (not draft mode)
5. Copy automation ID from URL: `app.beehiiv.com/automations/[AUTOMATION_ID]`
6. Add `BEEHIIV_AUTOMATION_ID=aut_xxxxx` to `.env.local`

**ðŸ’¡ Recommendation**: Use Option 1 (Auto-Trigger) as it's more reliable and doesn't depend on API endpoint changes.

## Testing & Monitoring

### Testing Checklist:
- [ ] Environment variables configured correctly
- [ ] Test email submission through both forms (hero + secondary)
- [ ] Verify subscriber appears in Beehiiv dashboard
- [ ] Check automation enrollment success
- [ ] Test error handling (invalid emails, network issues)
- [ ] Verify fallback localStorage behavior in development
- [ ] Test rate limiting functionality

### Monitoring & Analytics:
- **Beehiiv Dashboard**: Monitor subscriber growth, email open rates, automation performance
- **Browser Console**: Check for API errors and integration issues in development
- **Local Storage**: Backup data available for development/debugging
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in protection logs abuse attempts

### Common Issues:
- **"Environment variable missing"**: Check .env.local file has all required variables
- **"API key invalid"**: Verify Beehiiv API key has correct permissions
- **"Automation not found"**: Ensure automation is published and ID is correct
- **"Network errors"**: Check Beehiiv service status and internet connection
